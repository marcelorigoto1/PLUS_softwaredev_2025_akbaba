Quote: "A real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out." - Walter Winchell
Food I dont like: I dont like to eat only grass in a food. 
Recommendation: I recommend you to learn ski if you havent already, it is so much fun. The interesting part is that you fall many times but you learn to get up. 
German Word I learned: Use Guten Morgan to greet people in the morning.
